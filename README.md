# jupyter-demo
Demonstration of Jupyter usage at the department and elsewhere


To use a hosted Jupyter environment:

- Snake: https://snake.ugent.be (available for all university personnel/students)
  - To use this, you first have to activate a helios account: https://helpdesk.ugent.be/account/helios.php. Once activated, you can use your UGent CAS account to log in.

- Eraser:  https://eraser1.ugent.be:8000/ (only for Biomath people)
  - Log in with your eraser-account. This runs the notebooks on the eraser cluster

If your are not connected to the university internet, you can also use https://try.jupyter.org/
